-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Upgrading ALL VERSIONS --

	When upgrading Ampache extract the new .tar.gz into your existing
	webpath, and then make sure that the /config/ampache.cfg.php from 
	your old install is copied into the new directory, then follow any 
	instructions provided via the web interface. 

	*** If you have any tag issues always run a verify after upgrading **

	Specifics for upgrading between versions are provided below

- Migrating from Ampache 3.4.x --> 3.5

	If Ampache reports that your config file is 'unreadable' after
	upgrading open your config file and remove all configuration
	options relating to RSS Feeds, these options should be at the bottom. 
	This is due to a change in PHP versions which is often done at the
	same time as an Ampache upgrade. 

- Migrating from Ampache 3.3.x --> 3.4

	The config file format has changed, please follow the instructions
	in the web interface. Depending on the age of your Ampache install
	this may not work as a large number of pre 3.3.3.x updates were
	removed from the update file. 

- Migrating from Ampache 3.3.x --> 3.3.3
	
	The newest release of Ampache will prompt Admins to download and 
	install a config file if their current one is out of date. While
	ampache may work without the new config file, results may vary 
	it is strongly recommended that if prompted you install the newly
	created config file.

- Migrating from Ampache 3.3 --> 3.x+

	After running /update.php check /test.php to make sure that you 
	still meet all the requirements, and that your config file is up to
	date. 

- Migrating from Ampache 3.3 --> 3.3.x+

	Rename your /config/ampache.cfg to /config/ampache.cfg.php

- Migrating from Ampache-3.1.0 --> 3.3

	Follow the instructions found in $yourwebsite/update.php

- Migrating from Ampache-3.1-Alpha2 or Alpha --> Ampache 3.1-Alpha3
	
	Please visit $yourwebsite/update.php to update the genre table. 
	If you are updating from Alpha2 to Alpha3 or higher.
	This will invalidate your current catalog. 
	
- Migrating from Ampache-3.0 --> Ampache3.1

	The tools to migrate Ampache 3.0 to 3.1 Are no longer supported
	and will not work against the newest versions of the software. 
	Sorry for any inconvience.
